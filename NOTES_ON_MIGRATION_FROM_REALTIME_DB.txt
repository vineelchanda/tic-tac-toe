MIGRATION NOTES (Realtime DB -> Firestore):

CHANGES:
- Path moved from /games/<id> (RTDB) to collection games/<id> doc.
- Listener: onValue -> onSnapshot.
- Atomic updates: runTransaction in Firestore instead of RTDB runTransaction (logic similar).
- Presence: Firestore does not natively clear on disconnect; previous onDisconnect cleanup not available. Future approach: dual DB (Firestore for state, RTDB for presence) or periodic cleanup job.

FOLLOW-UPS:
- Implement presence tracking.
- Strengthen rules to enforce correct moves server-side.
- Optionally add subcollections for chat or history.

BENEFITS:
- Structured documents, powerful querying if extended.
- Multi-document transactions available if future features need cross-game effects.

RISKS:
- Without strict rules or auth, malicious clients can mutate games.
- Need cloud cleanup to prevent unbounded game document growth.
