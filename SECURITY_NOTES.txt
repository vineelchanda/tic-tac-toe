HARDENING SUGGESTIONS:
1. Require authenticated users; store UID instead of random ephemeral IDs.
2. Firestore rules:
   - Allow join only if seat currently null.
   - Allow move only if:
       a) status == 'in_progress'
       b) correct player's turn
       c) board[index] == ''
   - Validate win/draw transitions (can replicate winner logic partially in rules).
3. Cloud Functions:
   - Periodically mark stale games abandoned if lastMoveAt older than threshold.
   - Archive completed games.
4. Add rate limiting for resets; store reset counter + timestamp.
5. Use Realtime Database (presence) or a heartbeat field for robust online status.
